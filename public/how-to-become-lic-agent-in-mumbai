                    Mumbai: What is it about?</h2>
                <p>LIC India aims to help Indian citizens to safeguard their lives with an array of profitable insurance
                    policies. That is why this national insurance provider of the country needs to reach as many people

                    short, LIC agents work as contractors, who help LIC India to get new policyholders.</p><br />
                <p>Many people, such as students, senior citizens, businesspeople, or homemakers, have started
                    preferring to be LIC agents. Did you know some people became LIC agents with their full-time jobs to

                <p>If you are interested in becoming a LIC agent, there is some good news for you. LIC India made a
                    change in the eligibility criteria for becoming a LIC agent with respect to educational
                    qualifications. Now, you can start your career as a LIC agent if you have passed the class-10
