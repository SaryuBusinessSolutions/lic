Now, you may wonder what perks you can\r\n                    expect to receive after becoming a LIC agent.

You are not going to sell a day-to-day commodity to a person, rather you are about\r\n                        to help someone ensure financial security with your services.</p><br />\r\n                    <p>However, this significant responsibility would be awarded proper remuneration. To put it\r\n                        differently, the profession of a LIC agent is considered the “best paid hard work”, so you would\r\n                        just need to focus on your work without worrying about the value of your commission.</p><br />\r\n                        <p>The more dedication you would provide the more success you can expect to achieve, which\r\n                            would be translated into more earnings to secure your life. One of the best aspects of being a\r\n                            LIC agent is that one sale would provide you with repeated commission payments. It holds true\r\n                            even after the death or resignation of the respective LIC agent considering compliance with all\r\n                            applicable rules.

Every sale would make you eligible to achieve 35% of the\r\n                        premium value in the very first year of the respective LIC policy.</p><br />\r\n                    <p>Next, the second and third years of the policy would bring 7.5% of the premium amount for\r\n                        you. And last but not least, you would keep receiving 5% every year until the policy tenure gets\r\n                        completed.</p>\r\n                </section>\r\n                <section class=\"mb-8\">\r\n                    <h3 class=\"font-semibold text-lg mb-4\">Interest-Free Loan:</h3>\r\n                    <p>Another worth-noting perk of being a LIC agent is the convenience of receiving interest-free\r\n                        loans from Life Insurance Corporation of India to cater to financial requirements or to fulfill\r\n                        financial obligations, such as home loans, car loans, festival loans, and so on.

Moreover, if you would like to continue your profession even after\r\n                        the general age of retirement, you are free to do that, as this career does not come with any\r\n                        retirement age.</p><br />\r\n                        <p>That means you can keep earning as much as you want and as long as you like. One of the most\r\n                            worth-noting benefits of being a LIC agent lies in its attractive earning potential with a\r\n                            substantial commission on all previous sales of policies.
